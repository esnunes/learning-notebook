## Getting Started 

From the root of your Hugo site, clone the theme into `themes/cocoa` by running:

````
git clone https://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme.git themes/cocoa
````

Then, generate your site's files by running:

````
hugo -t cocoa
````

## Usage

#### Creating Content

* Posts should generally go under a `content/blog` directory. Typically you would run:

````
hugo new blog/your-new-post.md
````

* Fixed pages such as an About page should preferably go under a `content/fixed` or be present at the root of the `contents` directory.

````
$ hugo new fixed/about.md
````

#### Site variables

Please see the sample [`config.toml`](https://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) under the `exampleSite/` directory. 

#### Example site

An example site is available under the `exampleSite/` directory.
