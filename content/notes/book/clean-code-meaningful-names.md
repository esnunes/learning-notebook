Here is a list of best practices on namming variables, classes, functions /
methods, interfaces and enums:

- Communicate your intent;
- Avoid disinformation;
- Pronounceable names;
- Avoid encodings (e.g. Hungarian notation);
- Classes, variables names should be nouns;
- Methods / functions should have verb names;
- Boolean methods should have names as predicates (e.g. isAuthenticated);
- Variables should have short names in small scopes and long names in large 
  scopes;
- Functions should have long names in small scopes and short names in large 
  scopes;
- Classes should have long names in private scopes and short names in public
  scopes;
