This is a very interesting video that demonstrates the power of using DDD
together with Ports & Adapters pattern. I totally agree with the concept.
By using Ports & Adapters you can easily understand the business logic without
having to look at boilerplate code (the ports and adapters).

The speaker recommends the book "Building Microservices - Desining fine-grained
systems". The speaker mentions that the book cover lots of ideas of DDD and
ports & adapters, that it is worth reading it in case you agree with the
things he speaks of.
