A nice talk from Ciaran McNulty regarding how to use examples to describe
functionality. Ciaran starts introducing the concept of Behavior Driven
Development, he points out the [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference)
format used to describe scenarios.

Ciaran mentions who should be part of the definition of the scenarios as well
as when they should be listed.

On the second part Ciaran gives an overview of Domain Driven Design (DDD) and
how it helps the communication between all members of the team.

Ciaran points out the tool [Behat](http://behat.org/en/latest/) as a framework
for checking if the described behavior works.

Ciaran gives some tips of how to actively enhance the examples.

Ciaran gives some examples of how to map
[Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference) scenarios to PHP code using
[Behat](http://behat.org/en/latest/). At this moment Ciaran implements the PHP
code using TDD.
