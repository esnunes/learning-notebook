Very nice article comparing performance, latency, memory usage and size between
simple web services written in nodejs and golang.

Although the article is titled as a draw it points out by metrics that golang is
a winner.

> The things that drove my attention are the very low memory footprint of golang
> and the minimum size of a Docker image running the service. Considering the
> amount of resources required to develop and run microservices, at least in
> small / medium companies with limited resources, golang seems to be the best
> option.
