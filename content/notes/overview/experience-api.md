Experience API is also known as [Tin Can API or xAPI](https://tincanapi.com/overview/tin-can-xapi).

It is an evolved version of SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model).

## Format

The format is quite simple: `Noun, verb, object`.

## Entities

- Activity Provider (AP): responsible to create and track learning experiences;
- Learning Record Store (LRS): responsible to store the tracking data;
- Activity: it is the object in the `Noun, verb, object` protocol. E.g. a book, an e-learning course, a meeting, some real object like a chair in a classroom, etc;
- Actor: individual or group that does the action;

## Notes

`Verb` must be in the past tense, although their display properties may be flexible in tense.
